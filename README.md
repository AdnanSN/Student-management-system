Greetings people!!!

This is a simple Student Management System built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The system allows users to manage student information, including adding new students and viewing a list of students.

**Features**

Home Page:

A simple homepage that greets users and offers two options:

**View Student List**: Redirects to the student list page.

**Add a New Student**: Redirects to the page where users can add a new student.

**Add a New Student:**

Users can input a student's name, age, and grade.

Upon submitting, the student is added to the student list.

**View Student List:**

Displays a table of all students, showing their ID, Name, Age, and Grade.

Each student also has a Delete option, allowing users to remove the student from the list.

**Modern Design:**

The system features a modern, visually appealing UI with gradient backgrounds and clean, responsive layout.

Buttons and tables are styled for better user experience.


**Technology Stack**

Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
Styling: Custom CSS with gradients for a modern look
Data Storage: Stored in memory (using Python lists)

**How It Works**

The application starts on the Home Page, where users can choose to view the list of students or add a new student.
On the Add Student page, users fill out a form with student details (name, age, and grade), which is then saved.
The View Student List page displays all the students, and users can delete individual students if needed.
A Home button is available on every page, allowing users to navigate back to the homepage easily.
